# Image Processing with OpenCV
Here I worked with the OpenCV library of python. 

About the code-

The code takes a video of volleyball match in mp4 format and splits it into frames. Then it takes the csv file containing the bounding boxes around the players given by a deep learning model. It puts the bounding boxes around the corresponding player and outputs a video containing the bounding box on that player.
